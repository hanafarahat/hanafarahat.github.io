<!-- Really good job on this! Main obvservation is that the page is set to a fixed width of 1000px.  Almost all modern websites have some degree of responsiveness so it would be good to see if you could keep the page styles yet not have this fixed width. Or, if you do want to keep the fixed width, center the page content. -->
